### Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.

#### Tasks :
- Check out the given **Matrix** class and **MatrixUtils** methods.

- Write test functions to validate your implementations.

- Open a pull request with your final implementation. (Best of all implementations will be chosen and the future exercises will be solved using the picked PR.)
