# Time to Develop !

### Tasks :

1) Implement += [operator](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators) for our Matrix class 
2) Implement [Matrix-Matrix Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_multiplication#Illustration) 
3) Implement transpose operation. (you can use a member function transpose() or maybe operator~)
4) Benchmark current **serial** operations, then implement matrix data structure as a single vector, instead of vector of vectors and benchmark again. Do you see an improvement?
